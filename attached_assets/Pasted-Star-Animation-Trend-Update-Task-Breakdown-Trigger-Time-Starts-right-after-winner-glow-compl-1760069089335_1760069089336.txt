Star Animation + Trend Update — Task Breakdown
🕒 Trigger Time

Starts right after winner glow completes (around 19–21 seconds of the round).

Duration: ~2 seconds total animation.

Purpose: Show the winner moving to the trend area, then update the trend list.

🎬 1️⃣ Star Creation (At Winner Area)

Goal: Create a glowing star with tailing effect from the winner’s betting area (e.g., Dragon, Tiger, or Tie).





Set initial position:

Center of the winner betting area.

Get bounding box (using getBoundingClientRect()) for accurate coordinates.

Play subtle “win sparkle” sound (optional).

🪄 2️⃣ Star Animation (Floating to Trend Area)

Goal: Move the star smoothly from the winner area to the Trend bar.

✅ Tasks:

Calculate target position:

Target = position of Trend container’s first empty slot (rightmost).

Use bounding rect difference to compute translation (x, y).

Animate with smooth easing:

Duration: 2s

Easing: easeInOut



CSS: transition: transform 2s cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1);

Framer Motion:




glow trail:

Use pseudo-element or small particles for trailing sparkle.

Fade out gradually as star moves.

At end of animation:

Remove the star element.

Trigger the Trend Update function.

📊 3️⃣ Trend Update (After Star Reaches Target)

Goal: Update the visual trend list with the new result (e.g., add “Dragon”, “Tiger”, or “Tie”).

✅ Tasks:

Slide existing records left:

Animate current trend items moving left by one slot (smooth).




Insert new result at rightmost:

Append a new record with the winner result.




Trend “bounce” effect 

Slight bounce or glow on the new item to emphasize it’s fresh.

scale: [1, 1.1, 1] with 0.4s transition.

Ensure placeholder slots are gone:

Don’t use box placeholders.

Smoothly shift and fill with real records only.

Limit trend list to last 10 results:

If length > 10, remove the oldest one smoothly (fade or slide-out).

🔁 4️⃣ Cleanup (After Trend Update)
✅ Tasks:

Remove star and temporary animation layers.

Reset any “in-transition” flags.

Ensure betting areas are cleared and ready for next round.
